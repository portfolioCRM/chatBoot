# Project Use Guide

## Environment Setup

To get started with the project, you need to set up your environment. This project uses Python and Flask, so ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### 1. Install Python

You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

To run the Flask application, use the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Deployment

For deploying the Flask application in a production environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Choose a Deployment Platform

You can deploy the Flask application using various platforms such as:

- **Heroku**: A platform as a service (PaaS) that simplifies deployment.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: A scalable deployment service.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.

### 2. Set Up Deployment Configuration

- **Heroku**: Follow the [Heroku deployment guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python).

```bash
heroku create
git push heroku main
```

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Follow the [Elastic Beanstalk deployment guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html).

```bash
eb create my-flask-app
eb deploy
```

- **Docker**: Create a `Dockerfile` and use Docker commands to build and run your container.

**Dockerfile Example:**

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=server.py

# Run the application
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

```bash
docker build -t my-flask-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Ensure that you configure any required environment variables for your production environment. For example, you might need to set database connection strings or API keys.

### 4. Running the Production Server

For production, consider using a production WSGI server such as Gunicorn:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 server:app
```

This will start the Flask application with 4 worker processes, which is suitable for handling multiple requests.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you secure your application by configuring proper security settings and using HTTPS in production.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the project's [README.md](README.md) file or consult the documentation for Flask and your deployment platform.
